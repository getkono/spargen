//! # spargen
//!
//! A compile-time-correct Rust HTTP client generator for OpenAPI 3.1.x. Spec in, spar out:
//! everything structural is decided at generation time; nothing is interpreted at runtime.
//!
//! This crate is the library half of the `spargen` tool. Its public surface is the `build.rs`
//! API — see the [facade](crate) items ([`Config`], [`generate`], [`check`], [`explain`]).
//!
//! ## Subsystem layering (PRD §2.3)
//!
//! The crate is internally partitioned into subsystems with a declared dependency DAG. Each
//! subsystem module records its allowed dependencies in a machine-readable `//! layer-deps:`
//! header; the future `xtask lint-layers` job diffs those declarations against the actual
//! inter-module `use` edges and fails on any edge not in the table below.
//!
//! | Subsystem | May depend on |
//! |-----------|---------------|
//! | `diag`    | —             |
//! | `source`  | `diag`        |
//! | `ir`      | `diag`        |
//! | `oas31`   | `source`, `ir`, `diag` |
//! | `name`    | `ir`, `diag`  |
//! | `support` | — (compiles standalone against reqwest/serde) |
//! | `codegen` | `ir`, `name`, `support`, `diag` |
//! | `emit`    | `codegen`, `diag` |
//! | `cli`     | facade        |
//! | facade (`lib.rs`) | all of the above |
//!
//! Pipeline: `source` → `oas31` → (`ir` + `name`) → `codegen` → `emit`, with `diag` as the
//! only vocabulary shared across stages.

// TODO(impl): remove these once subsystem bodies are implemented and the pipeline is wired.
// Stub signatures leave params unused; stub structs carry private fields nothing reads yet; and
// subsystem re-exports have no in-crate consumers until later stages depend on them.
