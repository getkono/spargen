//! `corpus/manifest.toml` as the single source of corpus expectations.
//!
//! CLAUDE.md names the manifest as where a pinned spec's expected outcome lives, and says
//! expectations change "only with a reviewed reason". Nothing read it: the same expectations were
//! restated by hand in the `corpus-smoke` mise task, again in the CI job, and again in
//! `tests/snapshot.rs`. They had already drifted — `openai-openapi` was in the manifest and the
//! snapshot suite but in neither smoke copy.
//!
//! This suite drives the manifest itself, and holds the other copies to it.
//!
//! One manifest field stays unchecked: `tree_sha256`, carried by `openapi-boilerplate` alone. How
//! it was constructed is recorded nowhere, and no natural definition over that directory
//! reproduces it, so verifying it would mean inventing a rule and calling the result a guarantee.
//! Every case's `sha256` — the per-file pin the support documents cite — is verified below.
